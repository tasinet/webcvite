                                I’m a Zend PHP Certified Engineer focused on security with experience on payment processors, distributed queues, high traffic websites and Amazon AWS. A few years ago I get my certification as Zend PHP Certified Engineer but I'm also certified as Apple Certified Support Professional and Apple Certified Technical Coordinator.
                                <br>
                                Right now I spend most of my time working at GREE UK, Ltd. as a game backend engineer but also writing my first book about Zend Framework 2 that will be published by Packt Publishing. After that if I still have time I love to cook.

                                In this company I'm part of the studio backend team and we are focused on handling all the data and backend processes related with our games.<br>
                                We design, code, test and deploy all the backend side of the GREE UK mobile games.<br>
                                While developing our first EU game I was in charge of all the tasks related with path finding, path validation, node placement and map generation using python.

                                In this startup I’m in charge of all the technical lead, coordinating developers, designers, ux managers, seo, content team, i18n team and meeting with the CEO and business persons to plan and develop the company priorities. The project is built using Zend Framework, a few Amazon AWS API’s and gearman for parallel distributed processing of images, emails, analytics, uploads, metrics, etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As I’m more developer than manager I also get involved in the development process along with the team usually taking care about the payment gateway and gearman stuff. We do code review of all the changes and we maintain a test environment using PHPUnit, Mink, Goutte and Sahi.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On the server side, I manage two big boxes, one for staging and another for production us- ing nginx + php-fpm + gearman + memcache + apc + mysql + capistrano + monit + munin + new relic.

                                On the management side we use JIRA and Confluence for tickets and wiki, bitbucket with git for the code repository and pomodoro for the time management.

                                In this startup I was mainly focused in modelmanagement.com and casting.net projects. modelmanagement.com is a high traffic social network to connect models, photographers and model agencies with more than 58k models, 10k photographers, 3k agencies, 1.5M unique images and we had 1 million pageviews per month.
                                <br>
                                Normally I take care about the following aspects of the projects:

                                In casting.net project I was the responsible about all the aspects of the project, from the architecture to the last small part included server setup and maintenance. I can say that
                                is made on top of Zend Framework and is using Amazon S3 + Amazon Cloud Front as the CDN and Amazon SNS as a internal notification system, also we used gearman to do pararell processing of images, emails, analytics, etc. The deploy is done using capistrano and the project is running on a linux machine in a Zend Server environment.

                                In Vendo I was working on the frontend, backoffice and fulfillment engine of the platform. The project was used in adult content websites and online stores as a payment gateway and site management in a high traffic environment with 1 million visits per day and more than 3 million pageviews per day. We were working using Scrum as an Agile methodology to develop new features and Zend Framework as the base framework.

                                Nowadays, it is increasingly common to find websites with JavaScript enhanced forms. JavaScript allows us to create custom interactions with the usual fields and create complex ways to gather data – for example, allowing the user to attach as many files as they want. These kinds of interactions present some problems we have to address; we don’t know beforehand how many files will be attached, and that affects the processing of the form, the data validation, and the form repopulation in case of error. What about integrating that inside Zend Framework? Sounds hard, but is easier than it seems.
