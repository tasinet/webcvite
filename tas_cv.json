			"I started YouRad.io as a personal project in October 2011. I developed this \"Social Media Player\" to aggregate media links from social accounts (Facebook) for consumption. Recognises Youtube, Soundcloud and Vimeo links. It uses a heuristic algorithm to decide \"music/not music\" (and separate the two) and offers \"star\", \"tag\", \"like\" and \"comment\" functionality. The app-like interface, written in Javascript, allows for navigation without interrupting the embedded player. Front-end styled with Bootstrap (by Twitter). Served from nginx and MongoDB, hosted on Amazon EC2. <b>Currently seeking funding.</b>"
